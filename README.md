# Interactive Password Generator
With the help of this small Python console application, secure passwords can be generated in seconds.
The program interactively queries the user for the following options:
  - Length of the password
  - Should special characters be used?
  - Should numbers be used?
  - Should uppercase and/or lowercase symbols be used?
  - Should similar looking symbols such as i, I, l, L, o, O, 0 be excluded?

In the future, even more choices will be available and the strength of the password will be validated directly.
